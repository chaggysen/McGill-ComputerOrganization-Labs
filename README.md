## Lab 1:
Learn how to work with an ARM processor and the basics of ARM assembly by programming some common routines.

### Part 1:
Implement a well-known optimization technique, namely stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is the backbone of a wide range of machine learning algorithms. We will use the SGD technique to solve a simple problem: finding the square root of an integer number.
