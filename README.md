## Lab 1:
Learn how to work with an ARM processor and the basics of ARM assembly by programming some common routines.

### Part 1:
Implement a well-known optimization technique, namely stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is the backbone of a wide range of machine learning algorithms. Use the SGD technique to solve a simple problem: finding the square root of an integer number.

### Part 2:
In this part, calculate the norm of a vector (array).

### Part 3:
Implement an algorithm that “centers” a vector (array). It is often necessary to ensure that a signal is “centered” (that is, its average is 0). For example, DC signals can damage a loudspeaker, so it is important to center an audio signal to remove DC components before sending the signal to the speaker. The program should be able to accept the signal length as an input parameter.
